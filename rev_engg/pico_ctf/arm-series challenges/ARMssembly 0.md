## Description
What integer does this program print with 
arguments 4112417903 and 1169092511? 
File: chall.S 
Flag format: picoCTF{XXXXXXXX} -> (hex, lowercase, no 0x, and 32 bits.
ex. 5614267 would be picoCTF{0055aabb})

I would say that I am somewhat comfortable with classic x86 assembly, but I had to learn about ARM for this challenge

this is pure gpt info, that I needed to refer as I went along with this challenge.

In ARM assembly language, the instructions and directives you mentioned serve different purposes, from performing operations to defining sections and managing data. 
Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of each:

### Instructions

1. **`sub`**: 
   - **Operation**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
   - **Example**: `sub sp, sp, #16` subtracts 16 from the stack pointer (`sp`), effectively allocating 16 bytes on the stack.

2. **`str`**: 
   - **Operation**: Stores a value from a register into memory.
   - **Example**: `str w0, [sp, 12]` stores the value in register `w0` at the address `sp + 12`.

3. **`ldr`**: 
   - **Operation**: Loads a value from memory into a register.
   - **Example**: `ldr w1, [sp, 12]` loads the value stored at the address `sp + 12` into register `w1`.

4. **`cmp`**: 
   - **Operation**: Compares two values.
   - **Example**: `cmp w1, w0` compares the values in `w1` and `w0` and sets the flags in the condition code register based on the result.

5. **`bls`**: 
   - **Operation**: Branches to a label if the previous comparison result was "below or same" (used for unsigned comparisons).
   - **Example**: `bls .L2` jumps to label `.L2` if the previous comparison showed that `w1` is less than or equal to `w0`.

6. **`b`**: 
   - **Operation**: Unconditionally branches to a specified label.
   - **Example**: `b .L3` jumps to label `.L3`.

7. **`add`**: 
   - **Operation**: Adds two values.
   - **Example**: `add x0, x0, 8` adds 8 to the value in `x0`.

8. **`ret`**: 
   - **Operation**: Returns from the current function, usually restoring the link register.
   - **Example**: `ret` jumps back to the address stored in the link register (`x30`).

### Directives
9. **`.size`**: 
   - **Purpose**: Defines the size of a function or data segment.
   - **Example**: `.size func1, .-func1` sets the size of the function `func1`.

10. **`.section`**: 
    - **Purpose**: Specifies the beginning of a section in the assembly file, such as `.text` for code or `.data` for initialized data.
    - **Example**: `.section .rodata` indicates the start of a read-only data section.

11. **`.align`**: 
    - **Purpose**: Aligns the next data or instruction to a specified boundary (in bytes).
    - **Example**: `.align 2` aligns the next section to a 4-byte boundary.

12. **`.string`**: 
    - **Purpose**: Declares a string constant.
    - **Example**: `.string "Result: %ld\n"` defines a string that can be used in output functions.

13. **`.text`**: 
    - **Purpose**: Indicates the start of a section that contains executable code.
    - **Example**: `.text` marks the beginning of the code section of the program.

14. **`.global`**: 
    - **Purpose**: Declares a symbol that can be accessed from other files or modules.
    - **Example**: `.global func1` makes `func1` accessible from other files.

15. **`.type`**: 
    - **Purpose**: Specifies the type of a symbol, such as a function or object.
    - **Example**: `.type func1, %function` declares `func1` as a function.

16. **`adrp`**: 
    - **Operation**: Loads the upper part of an address into a register. It is used for accessing memory in a different page.
    - **Example**: `adrp x0, .LC0` loads the address of the section `.LC0` into `x0`, adjusting for page alignment.

17. **`mov`**: 
    - **Operation**: Moves (copies) a value from one register to another or from an immediate value to a register.
    - **Example**: `mov w0, w19` copies the value from `w19` into `w0`.

18. **`ldp`**: 
    - **Operation**: Loads two values from memory into two registers at once.
    - **Example**: `ldp x29, x30, [sp], 48` loads values from the stack into `x29` and `x30`, then updates `sp` to point to the next address after the loaded data.

### Summary
These instructions and directives form the core of programming in ARM assembly language, enabling you to manipulate data, control program flow, and structure your code effectively. Each serves a specific purpose that contributes to the overall functionality of the assembly program.
