(Apologies I was unaware of flag submission and thus, flags are only noted down starting the last challenge of this module aka "home sweet home".)

Overview of the module: Basics of Linux file paths

A path from the root of the filesystem starts with /. 
And two kinds of paths were covered namely - absolute and relative. 

for me, all of the challenges were not much of hassles to overcome. But the last one, "Home Sweet Home" took me a little longer than the other ones.

"Home Sweet Home"
description: 
In this challenge, /challenge/run will write a copy of the flag to any file you specify as an argument on the commandline, with these constraints:
1) Your argument must be an absolute path.
2) The path must be inside your home directory.
3) Before expansion, your argument must be three characters or less.
