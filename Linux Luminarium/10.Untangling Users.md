## Challenge 3 - Cracking passwords
**Overview:** by :s, the first field of each line is the username and the second is the password
When you input a password into su, it one-way-encrypts (hashes) it and compares the result against the stored value. If the result matches, su grants you access to the user!
The cracking can be done via the famous John the Ripper

**Commands:** 
`ran john /challenge/shadow-leak in the terminal to crack the password hashes in the file shadow-leak
got the cracked password aardvark for the user zardus
ran su zardus in the terminal to switch to the user zardus and got prompted to enter the password
entered the password aardvark and became the user zardus
ran /challenge/run in the terminal to run the command and got the flag`

## Challenge 4 - using sudo 
**Overview:**can leak, and they don't lend themselves well to larger environments (e.g., fleets of servers). To address this, in recent decades, the world has moved from administration via su to administration via sudo (superuser do).
su, which defaults to launching a shell as a specified user, sudo defaults to running a command as root:

**Commands:** 
`ran sudo cat /flag in the terminal to read the contents of the file flag as the root user and got the flag:
hacker@users~using-sudo:~$ sudo cat /flag`
